Here's the plan:\n\n**1. Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Home Screen:** A welcoming home screen featuring key information from the website, such as upcoming events, daily prayer timings, and important announcements.\n-   **Deities Section:** A dedicated section showcasing the deities of the temple, potentially with images and brief descriptions.\n-   **Events Calendar:** An interactive calendar displaying temple events, festivals, and special programs. Users should be able to view event details.\n-   **Donation Feature:** A section where users can make donations to the temple.\n\n**2. Design Elements:**\n\n-   **Colors:**\n    -   Background: #F8F8FF (Light background to provide a clean and serene feel)\n    -   Text: #2E2E2E (Dark gray for readability)\n    -   TextSecondary: #6A6A6A (A lighter gray for less important text)\n    -   Primary: #A52A2A (Brown, echoing the temple's traditional colors)\n    -   Secondary: #B8860B (Dark Goldenrod, for highlights and accents)\n    -   Accent: #D2691E (Chocolate, for interactive elements)\n    -   Card: #FFFFFF (White, for content containers)\n    -   Highlight: #FAF0E6 (Light golden background for highlighted sections)\n-   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\n**3. Implementation Plan:**\n\n1.  **Modify the Home Screen (`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`):**\n    -   Update the content to reflect key information from the Tampa Ayyappa Temple website.\n    -   Include sections for upcoming events, prayer timings, and announcements.\n    -   Style the home screen using the specified color palette and typography.\n2.  **Create a Deities Section:**\n    -   Add a new screen or component to display the deities of the temple.\n    -   Include images and descriptions for each deity.\n    -   Ensure the design aligns with the overall app theme.\n3.  **Implement an Events Calendar:**\n    -   Integrate a calendar component to display temple events.\n    -   Allow users to view event details (date, time, description, etc.).\n    -   Potentially fetch event data from an external source (if available).\n4.  **Add a Donation Feature:**\n    -   Create a section where users can make donations.\n    -   This could involve integrating with a payment gateway (if Supabase is enabled) or providing instructions for offline donations.\n5.  **Adjust Tab Bar (`app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`):**\n    -   Modify the tab bar to include icons and labels for the new sections (Deities, Events, Donation).\n    -   Ensure the tab bar design is consistent with the overall app theme.\n\n**4. Additional Instructions for the Coding Agent:**\n\n*   The modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-03T01:30:21.821596"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a React Native + Expo 54 app that complements the Tampa Ayyappa Temple website.
